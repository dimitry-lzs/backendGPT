The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the NodeJS service using Express.js are as follows:

1. `app.js` - The entry point file that initializes the Express.js application and defines the endpoints.
2. `diceController.js` - A controller module that handles the logic for the `/dice` endpoint.
3. `cardController.js` - A controller module that handles the logic for the `/card` endpoint.
4. `cardService.js` - A service module that generates a random card value.
5. `cardDeck.js` - A module that defines the card deck with all the possible card values.

Now, let's proceed with creating the files and writing the code.
